# JS Spread Operator Lab
## Instructions
1. Create an array that combines the given arrays in a way that counts from `1` to `9`.
````
console.log(arr4); //[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
````

2. Write a function that can take in any number of arguments, and returns the sum of all of the arguments.

3. Write a function called `onlyUniques` that can take in any number of arguments, and returns an array of only the unique arguments.
````
onlyUniques('cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'pig'); //['cat', 'dog', 'pig']
onlyUniques(1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 7, 4); //[1, 4, 7, 2]
````

4. Write a function called `combineAllArrays` that takes in any number of arrays as arguments and combines all of them into one array.
